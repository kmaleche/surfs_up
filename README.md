# Surfs Up

## Overview of the Analysis
This project is a weather analysis for the island of Oahu, performed to inform the business plan for an soon-to-open surf shop and ice cream stand. 

### Resources
The dataset consisted of daily weather data collected from measurement stations across Hawaii.

## Results
 - December temperatures on Oahu range from 56 degrees fahrenheit to 83.
 - The average temperature on Oahu in June is 75 degrees.
 - The average temperature on Oahu in December is 71 degrees.

## Summary
The results of our weather analysis should be reassuring to our investor if theg are concerned that lower temperatures in the winter may impact ice cream sales -- We found that, on average, December temperatures were only 4 degrees fahrenheit cooler than in June.

Two additional queries we would recommend, especially based on the investor's concerns regarding rainfall, weould be daily rainfall totals and daily windspeed. Both variables have the potential to affect beach turnout and ice cream sales.
